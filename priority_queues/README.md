# Priority Queues

# Methods
- Insert(element) - inserts an element
- ExtractMax - extracts an element with max priority
- Remove(index) - removes element at that index
- GetMax - returns the element with max priority
- ChangePriority(index, priority) - changes the priority of the element at the given index

## Possible Implementations
- Array
  - Unsorted
    - Insert - O(1)
    - ExtractMax - O(n)
  - Sorted
    - Insert - O(n)
      - finding place to insert using binary search is O(log(n))
      - but must shift all elements down in the array to insert making this 0(n)
    - ExtractMax - O(1)
      - max is just the last element in the array
- DoublyLinkedList w/tail
  - Unsorted
    - Insert - O(1)
    - ExtractMax - O(n)
  - Sorted
    - Insert - O(1)
    - ExtractMax - O(n)
      - cannot use binary search to find insertion point so it's O(n)
      - however once you find it the insert itself is O(1)
- BinaryHeap
  - One of the most common ways of creating a priority queue
  - Want to keep tree shallow so want it to be a complete binary tree so every method is at most O(log(n))
  - Binary max-heap
    - Binary tree w/nodes that have 0-2 children
    - value of the parent nodes are at least the value of their children
  - Insert - O(log(n))
    - slightly problematic.  You normally have to find an element that has less than two children
    - then check if it's value is less than the parent node.
    - If value is greater than parent node, you have to SiftUp (or swap child node with parent until it fits the definition for a binary heap)
      - The SiftUp function is at most O(TreeHeight)
  - ExtractMax - O(log(n))
    - Max is just the root node so easy to find
    - To extract
      - switch one of the leaf nodes with root
      - then SiftDown.
        - select left or right tree, whichever is greater, and swap until it fits the definition for a binary heap
  - GetMax - O(1)
    - it's just the root of the tree
  - ChangePriority - O(TreeHeight)
    - just need to SiftUp or SiftDown to make sure it fits the definition of binary heap definition
  - Remove - O(TreeHeight)
    - combination of ChangePriority and ExtractMax
    - essentially change priority of the node you want to remove to infinity so it will sift up to be the root
    - then call ExtractMax
  - Stored As Array
    - if binary heap is stored as array parent is i/2 and left child is 2i and right child is 2i + 1
